# **Maze King**
## *A game where the user attempts to escape while they earn points*

This application is a game where the user aims to go through a series of rooms, each with four doors, in order to make it to the 
final room and escape. The user earns points for each completed maze, where the fewer the amount of rooms visited before reaching 
the exit results in a higher score. If the user cannot escape they can look at the solution for a penatly to their score. In total 
there are seven mazes.

This project is of interest to me as it gave me the opportunity to practice recursion and to use graphs.

**User Stories**
 - As a user, I want to be able to resize the window without it ruining the game
 - As a user, I want to be able to control the game via the mouse or the keyboard
 - As a user, I want to be able to see the solution if I a am unable to escape

**Learnings/Updates**
- I added the instructional box on the left of the screen at the end quickly. To improve the app I would make it so during resizing 
  the box moves to the top of the page rather than hides behind the game board.
- Currently there are only seven mazes to play through. To improve I would make it so the game automatically generates the maze. 
  This would allow for an infinite number of mazes to play.
- An additional functionality I would add is allowing the user to select the difficulty of the maze.
